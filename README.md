# sorting-algorithms-analysis
Part 1 : 
Implementation of two types of sorting algorithms whose
complexity is O(n^2) : 
- Selection sort 
- Insertion sort

And another two types of sorting algorithms whose complexity 
is O(nlgn)
- Merge sort 
- Quick sort

Then passing 4 random arrays of different sizes 
(1000,25000,50000,100000) each array is passed 4 times to the 
4 sorting functions.
Using matplot library in python to plot the array sizes on x-axis 
versus the running time of the sorting functions on y-axis to 
observe the difference in performance between the 4 functions

Part 2 : 
- Implementation of hybrid sorting algorithm that apply 
merge sort till reaching a threshold value .then , the 
program sorts the subarray by selection sort.
- Finding kth smallest element in certain array using 
partition function.
